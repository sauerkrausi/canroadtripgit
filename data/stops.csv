Ilebizard,3,Parc-nature du Bois-de-l'Île-Bizard ,Bieaver Time!,-73.89656405,45.51630413,"First day in Canada, and already getting to know the local animals - two beavers! ",photos/3_beaver.jpg,https://photos.app.goo.gl/HJVnfYhekFZLUsiD9
ottawa,4,Ottawa,Parliament House Tour.,-75.6972,45.4215,"The capital. A lot of old buildings, but the tour of both chambers of pariament was great. Tour guides were as evasive in answering questions as the usual occupants of the buildings - I guess that comes with the job training.",photos/4_ottawa.jpg,https://photos.app.goo.gl/FmDGsrbLYCvJHKdc8
carp,5,Diefenbunker,Checking out Canada's Cold War Museum.,-76.0413,45.3491,Visited the old government bunker in case of a nuclear war. Pretty claustrophobic in it and not sure if you would like to live underground for long. Kathleen was amused by the primitive medical ward of the 60s and 70s. Some old person was still manning the radio station in the facilities - was talking to some amateur radio counterparts in the UK (a bit of a strange hobby).,photos/5_bunker.jpg,https://photos.app.goo.gl/Kg8LpMGcujtogohYA

wawagoose,7,Giant Goose,The true rulers of the North!,-84.7830,47.9772,"Even in Boston, the only being car drivers would stop for, were geese.

voyageurs,8,Voyageurs NP,"Lakes, lakes and more lakes. ",-93.1660,48.4839,"Short dip into the US, with the strangest boarder crossing over an old raildyard bridge.

Just made it out of the water before a storm hit the part (not the last thunderstorm that crossed our path....)",photos/8_voyageur.jpg,https://photos.app.goo.gl/5qQ7NeRT255KJrdy7
winnipeg,9,Winnipeg,Royal Mint and the Winnipeg Police Musem.,-97.1384,49.8951,"We did not expect much from Winnipeg, to be honest. Not an exciting town, but the Royal Mint tour and the Police Museum were great. The retired police officers running the museums were happy to tell and share their stories - must be something Gerald should do when he is retired!  The coffee place in the Forks was the highlight. Barista looked like a real one - schnauzer and tattoos, so that seemed legit. ",photos/9_winni.jpg,

regina,11,Regina,,-104.6189,50.4452,The only good thing about Regina was that we could bypass it. Not much to report about that city. The Regina-style pizza was ok. Better than Chicago Deep Dish for sure.,photos/11_regina.jpg,

Another sneaky thunderstorm with beautiful lightnings and winds made for rough camping. ",photos/13_grasslands.jpg,https://photos.app.goo.gl/i93JWi5FDoMVRGrz5
alberta,14,Welcome to Alberta,,-110.0252712,49.95450439,"90% of Alberta looks like Saskatchewan, and 10% are the mountains, which are nice!",photos/14_alberta.jpg,
waterton,15,Waterton NP,"Finally, the moutains!",-113.9144,49.0525,"Clear highlight of the trip. Crypt Lake hike was amazing (no bears - Kathleen was very sad), with stunning views and ice-cold water at the top for a nice cool-down. Felix did not sleep because he was thinking of hearing bears outside the tent, but was just the wind. ",photos/15_waterton.jpg,https://photos.app.goo.gl/yMQpWHPdTvsDHog7A
osoyoos,16,Osoyoos,The surpising stop in the wine-region of BC. ,-119.4597,49.0331,"A lot of rain did force us to skip most of the places we wanted to do (but they are only 5h from Vancouver, so will do another time).

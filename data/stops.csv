montreal,2,Montreal,Visiting Montreal and the McGraths.,-73.5673,45.5019,"Spending the week relaxing and unwinding in the suburbs, with a highlighly regimented lunch and dinner schedule. Also Felix can finally do some gardening. ",photos/2_montreal.jpeg,

ottawa,4,Ottawa,Parliament House Tour.,-75.6972,45.4215,"The capital. A lot of old buildings, but the tour of both chambers of pariament was great. Tour guides were as evasive in answering questions as the usual occupants of the buildings - I guess that comes with the job training.",photos/4_ottawa.jpg,
carp,5,Diefenbunker,Checking out Canada's Cold War Museum.,-76.0413,45.3491,Visited the old government bunker in case of a nuclear war. Pretty claustrophobic in it and not sure if you would like to live underground for long. Kathleen was amused by the primitive medical ward of the 60s and 70s. Some old person was still manning the radio station in the facilities - was talking to some amateur radio counterparts in the UK (a bit of a strange hobby).,,

wawagoose,7,Giant Goose,The true rulers of the North!,-84.7830,47.9772,"Even in Boston, the only being car drivers would stop for, were geese. So it is fitting that the true rulers of the northern subcontinent have a shrine dedicated to them, to remind us of their supreme grip of all beings wandering these lands. ",,
voyageurs,8,Voyageurs NP,"Lakes, lakes and more lakes. ",-93.1660,48.4839,"Short dip into the US, with the strangest boarder crossing over an old raildyard bridge.

winnipeg,9,Winnipeg,Royal Mint and the Winnipeg Police Musem.,-97.1384,49.8951,"We did not expect much from Winnipeg, to be honest. Not an exciting town, but the Royal Mint tour and the Police Museum were great. The retired police officers running the museums were happy to tell and share their stories - must be something Gerald should do when he is retired!  The coffee place in the Forks was the highlight. Barista looked like a real one - schnauzer and tattoos, so that seemd legit. ",,
saskatchewan,10,Welcome to Saskatchewan,Welcome to the Prairies!,-101.4475334,50.07581904,It is very flat,,
regina,11,Regina,,-104.6189,50.4452,The only good thing about Regina was that we could bypass it. Not much to report about that city. The Regina-style pizza was ok. Better than Chicago Deep Dish for sure.,,

waterton,15,Waterton NP,"Finally, the moutains!",-113.9144,49.0525,"Clear highlight of the trip. Crypt Lake hike was amazing (no bears - Kathleen was very sad), with stunning views and ice-cold water at the top for a nice cool-down. Felix did not sleep because he was thinking of hearing bears outside the tent, but was just the wind. ",,
osoyoos,16,Osoyoos,The surpising stop in the wine-region of BC. ,-119.4597,49.0331,"A lot of rain did force us to skip most of the places we wanted to do (but they are only 5h from Vancouver, so will do another time). Stopped for the night in Osoyoos, and was a lucky surprise. Warm, beaches and beautiful scenery. Reminded Felix of southern France with the vineyards and the beautiful sunsets.",,
vancouver,17,Vancouver,"At last, the West Coast",-123.1207,49.2827,"After 13 days of driving and nature, we finally made it to the West Coast! Enjoying the sunshine, the oceanview and beaches of Kitsilano and getting ready for the next adventure.",,
